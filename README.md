# Non Phy v5 â€” Bluebook Site

Welcome to the official repository and source portal for **Non Phy v5** â€” a foundational framework for emergent and causal physics.

This repository serves:
- As the base for the site hosted at [nonphy.org](https://nonphy.org)
- As a pointer to original publications, theory notes, and public registries (DOIs)
- As a verified entry point for researchers, collaborators, and physicists interested in foundational physics, coherence, and ontological dynamics
